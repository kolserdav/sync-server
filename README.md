# Synchronous-Server

## Overview
The `synchronous-server` package is a Node.js module that leverages Rust crates to enable the possibility of running a Node.js server synchronously. This package aims to provide a synchronously executed server implementation for Node.js, utilizing Rust's concurrency and performance capabilities.

## Installation
You can install the `synchronous-server` package using npm:

```bash
npm install synchronous-server
```

Make sure to have Rust installed on your system, as this package relies on Rust crates for its functionality.

## Usage
After installing the package, you can use it in your Node.js application as follows:

```javascript
const synchronousServer = require('synchronous-server');

// Start the synchronous server
synchronousServer.startServer(PORT);
```

Replace `PORT` with the port number on which you want the synchronous server to listen.

## Requirements
To use the `synchronous-server` package, you need to ensure the following:

- Node.js is installed on your system
- Rust is installed on your system

## API Reference
### `startServer(port: number)`
This function starts the synchronous server on the specified port.

- `port`: The port number on which the server should listen.

## Example
```javascript
const synchronousServer = require('synchronous-server');

const PORT = 3000;

// Start the synchronous server
synchronousServer.startServer(PORT);
console.log(`Synchronous server running on port ${PORT}`);
```
